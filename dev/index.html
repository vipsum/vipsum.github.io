        <p>I am a curious thinker, painter and developer of new worlds</p>
        <p>
          I enjoy creating new things that challenge my brain and giving old
          ones a newer and different meaning. As an energetic person I am always
          up to learning or doing something new. That's why when I first got
          interested in programming, I got immediatly excited and never stopped
          since then. I am constantly enhancing my skills to get the most of
          them and learning new ones that may help me change the world.
