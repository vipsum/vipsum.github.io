        <p>I am a curious thinker, painter and developer of new worlds</p>
        <p>
          I enjoy creating new things that challenge my brain and giving old
          ones a newer and different meaning. As an energetic person I am always
          up to learning or doing something new. That's why when I first got
          interested in programming, I got immediatly excited and never stopped
          since then. I am constantly enhancing my skills to get the most of
          them and learning new ones that may help me change the world.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am 20 years old and started studying programming when I was nineteen. Altough it has become a more and more 
          attractive career and hobbie, I have other passions to which I am fully devoted to, be that: Art. Besides being
           a developer, I am also a constantly learning oil painter.
          I enjoy passing my time brushing strokes and creating new shapes, people, views, animals, everything you could imagine. 
          Furthermore, it is in my plans to follow the career of Art History next year, since I have come to the realisation that that is the career that wraps up 
          everything I long to know about: well, obviously, <b>Art</b>.<br> <b>History.</b> And I'm not only talking about the life-story of the painter, but also about 
          the sociological and cultural aspects that revolved around his or her work. Every painter's work is undeniably
          directly related to society's status. And learning not only about the story of a painter, but also the world's history at the same time, sounds marvellous to me.<br>
          <b>Philosophy</b>. Philosophy is theoretical from beginning to end, whereas art is sensuous and imaginal. Philosophical thought reflects its subject-matter in concepts, 
          in categories; art is characterised, on the other hand, by emotional
           and imaginal reflection and by transformation of reality. <i>Astonishment.</i> A concept viewed by philosophy as the true nature of all beings, is a concepts that is <u>chained</u> to art. When you look into
           a painting and it surprises you, you are reminded that you are still human. Think about kids, as pure as they are, they get surprised about everythings because they do not
           take anything for granted, the world is a masterpiece to them, a whole new scenery to be discovered. That is art. And this text, long as it may be, is a part of who I am.
